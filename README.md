This is a project to organize TALE MC and data to train,
    test, and utililze ML models to find potential photon
    events. 


To Do:
a) Read in data
b) Organize data, applies any cuts
c) Split training and testing data *will need script later for training and using real data*
d) Decision Tree (with ability to tweak the model)
e) Random Forest
f) Adaboost
g) Lucas' model
h) Jamie's model
